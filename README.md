# High-Performance FST Waveform Writer

![CI Status](https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>/actions/workflows/on_pull_request.yml/badge.svg)
![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/<USER>/<GIST_ID>/raw/coverage.json)


A modern C++14 re-implementation of the **Fast Signal Trace (FST)** waveform writer, originally designed for [GtkWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/).

## 🚀 Overview

This project provides a highly optimized, standard-compliant C++ implementation of the FST writer API. The core of this project is written in **C++14** to ensure maximum compatibility with modern EDA tools and environments, specifically targeting performance improvements for **Verilator** simulations.

The unittests are written in C++20.

### Key Features
- **Modern C++ Design**: The core of this project is written in clean C++14.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed to reduce simulation overhead (2x faster than the original `fstapi` when used with Verilator).
- **Drop-in Compatibility**: Includes a C-compatible wrapper (`fstapi.cpp`) that mimics the original `fstapi.c` interface.
- **Robust Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests written in C++20 to ensure correctness.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized to keep the new C++ implementation separate from legacy or third-party code.

### Licensing Detailed
The project contains a mix of original code and redistributed files:

*   **`src/fstcpp/`**: The core of this project. Licensed under **MIT**.
*   **`src/gtkwave/`**: Redistributed from GtkWave. **MIT** or **BSD-2-Clause** (see file headers).
*   **`src/fstcpp/string_view.hpp`**: Lightweight `string_view` implementation. **Boost Software License**.

## 🛠️ Build & Installation

### Prerequisites
*   C++20 compatible compiler (GCC/Clang)
*   CMake (3.10 or higher)
*   Ninja (optional, recommended for speed)

### Setup for Development (VS Code)

To configure the project with debug symbols and prepare it for VS Code clangd:

```bash
# Generate build files using Ninja
cmake -G Ninja -B build/debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug src
```

### Compiling

```bash
# Build the project
cmake --build build/debug
```

---

## 🧪 Testing and Verification

This project uses a rigorous testing strategy, combining unit tests (C++20) and integration tests with Verilator.

To run the unit tests:

```bash
cd build/debug
ctest --verbose
```

For coverage reports (requires `lcov`):

```bash
# Run coverage script
./run_coverage.sh
```
